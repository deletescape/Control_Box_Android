This application is a project by Till Kottmann (Deletescape). This is just my hobby and so I am not responsible for anything (not even atomic warfare). This app is free but if you really like it I would always really appreciate a donation here: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZMUH9HW7655JA

The library used for handling SU permissions is libsuperuser by (the amazing) chainfire, go there and thank him, the master of root! (his repo can be found here: https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser)
