In future I will also put download Links for builds here, but as I am still in beta there are none yet (but you can always build yourself).\r\n  \r\nCurrently the app also hasn't got so many features... But with your Help we can make it **GREAAAT**\! You can do so by either giving feedback to me or by helping as a dev for the app\!\r\n  \r\n___\r\n\r\n###~ Till Kottmann (Deletescape)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
